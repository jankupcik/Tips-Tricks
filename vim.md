SEARCH
* [https://learnbyexample.gitbooks.io/vim-reference/content/Regular_Expressions.html]
* [http://vimregex.com/]
/ ?		without any text + <CR> = repeat last search
/abc<C-r><C-w>	put the currently highlighted word into the cmd line
/\v...		regular expressions => all symbols have a special meaning, use \ to escape
/\V...		verbatim search => no symbols have a special meaning
			except: / or ? and \ - these needs esc char '\' each time (Tip 79)
/.../e		find ... and move the cursor to the end (also possible /... + //e)
\w		word characters => a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _
\W		everything except word characters
<word>		< / > boundaries of \w+ => find words only (see * cmd)
/.\{-}X  every character until X
X\zs...\zeY	search for X...Y but highlight ... only
			/\v"\zs[^"]=\ze" => find "abc", highlight abc only
q/		open a separate window for search + <CR> to search
:%s//.../g	substitute last searched pattern

:vim[grep] /pattern/g WHERE
WHERE: *, **, ## (files in args), **/*.js (recursive)
:cnext, :cnfile, :copen, :clist

FOLDS

zo / zc / za	open / close / switch fold

ASCII/UNICODE VALUE OF THE CURRENT CHARACTER
